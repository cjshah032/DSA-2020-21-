1. Due to limited memory capacity of my PC only input files of size 10^7 could be generated and no larger than this. 
2. I created multiple files with 10^7 records and tested the program on each file. Then renamed these input files as Input1_10000000 so they could be recognized. 
3. Due to large size of output files containing sorted output, only 1 out of 5 could be uploaded.
