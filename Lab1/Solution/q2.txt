Ques: Consider a number n. Let p1, p2, ... pk be the distinct prime factors of n arranged in ascending order. Define f(n) as:
	f(n) = n - (Product of all pi ranging from 1 to k).
	Given a single number N, find the number of numbers n such that (2<=n<=N) and f(n) = 0;

Sample Test Input:
10

Sample Test Output:
6

Explanation: The f(n) = 0 for n = 2,3,5,6,7,10. 

Test:	Expected Output:
30	18
