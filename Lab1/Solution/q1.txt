Ques: Given a number N. Find the number of ways of making a sum of N, using only the numbers 3, 5 and 7. Example, if N = 10, there will be 3 combinations - {5+5}, {3+7} and {7+3}. Note that these combinations are ordered (i.e, 3 + 7 is a different combination than 7 + 3).
Result can get very large, so print answer modulo 1000000007
